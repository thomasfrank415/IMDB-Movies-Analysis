--Recreating the IMDB top-rated TV SHows with one query
--This formula provides a true 'Bayesian estimate', which takes into account the number of votes each title has received, minimum votes required to be on the list, and the mean vote for all titles
--Formula used by IMDB to get weighted rank for the top 250 tv shows:
	--weighted rank = (v/(v+m))*R + (m/(v+m))*C
	--Where:
		--R = average for the movie (mean)
		--v = number of votes for the movie
		--m = minimum votes required to be listed in the top 250 (currently 25000)
		--C = the mean vote across the whole report (sub-query to calculate)
