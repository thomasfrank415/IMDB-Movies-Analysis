--Recreating the IMDB Top 250 with one query
--Formula used by IMDB to get weighted rank for the top 250:
	--weighted rank = (v/(v+k))*X + (k/(v+k))*C
	--Where:
		--X = average for the movie (mean)
		--v = number of votes for the movie
		--k = minimum votes required to be listed in the top 250 (currently 25000)
		--C = the mean vote across the whole report (sub-query to calculate)
